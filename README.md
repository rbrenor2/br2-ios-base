## Br2 iOS Base
Br2 iOS Base is a foundational project that includes modules common to many apps I build. 
It uses Firebase as its BaaS and includes modules for Authentication, User Profile, and Preferences. 
The views are fully developed with SwiftUI and the app is structured using MVVM pattern.

## Wishlist
- Add a Cloudkit module containing both auth and data provided by it.
- Add a paywall module.
